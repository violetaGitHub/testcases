The JVM-based parsers (Java, C, C++) -as well as the external one- will now display more accurate error messages if an error is detected. Please have in mind that our bundled JVM-based parsers require JVM version 8 or higher!

[Bug]
SemanticSCM: An "Index was outside the bounds of the array" exception was thrown, caused by a problem in how the semantic differences were concurrently calculated. Fixed.

[Bug]
An exception with the message "specified argument was out of the range of valid values" appeared sometimes if the user switched quickly between file diffs. Fixed.

[Bug]
Semantic merge: A null exception was thrown sometimes trying to set the syntax language in the result textbox. Fixed.

[Bug]
A "Path cannot be null" exception was thrown when running a semantic merge that involved 3 text files and the "run the text merge tool" button was clicked. Fixed.

[Bug]
Semantic diff C#: some outline nodes (e.g. C# properties or regions) were not expanded even if they had differences. It was very uncomfortable. The user had to expand them manually in order to see the differences. Fixed.

[Bug]
A null exception was thrown when a changed-changed conflict was pending to solve and the result declaration was not present. Fixed.
